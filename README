What is it?
===========
A utility to convert html statements from egg.com into Ofx.  I use this to convert my egg statements and recent transactions into a format suitable for upload to wesabe.com.


Installation
============
$ gem install egg2ofx --source http://gemcutter.org


Usage
=====
Sign in to your egg credit card account and view your recent transactions or a statement for a specific date.  Save the page (html only) to your machine and then run:

$ egg2ofx downloaded-transactions.html > egg-statement.ofx
